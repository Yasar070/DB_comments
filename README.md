Library Database Management
This project involves managing a simple library database using MongoDB. The steps include creating a database named library and a collection called books, where various book documents can be stored. Initially, a book titled "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki, published in 1997, is inserted. The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations: retrieving all documents, finding specific authors, and identifying the earliest published book. Additionally, it includes updating the published year of a book and adding a "genre" field to all documents. The project also showcases deletion by removing books published before 1990. Lastly, it features an advanced query to fetch the top three recently published books. This README outlines the core functionalities of the library database, providing a foundational understanding for users interested in MongoDB operations.
